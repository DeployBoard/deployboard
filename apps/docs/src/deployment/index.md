# Deployment - Intro

Deploying your own instance of **DeployBoard** is relatively easy.

There are several ways to do it depending on your specific use case and the tools that you use.

- Use the pre-built docker image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/deployboard/deployboard).
- Build your own docker image from source code.
- Build and run the application from source without docker.

The easiest and recommended approach is to just use the pre-built docker image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/deployboard/deployboard).

!!! tip

    Before deploying, please read the [configuration](/deployment/configuration) page on how to configure DeployBoard.
